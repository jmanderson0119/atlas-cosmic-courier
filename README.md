# Atlas: Comic Courier
Welcome to the repository for Atlas: Cosmic Courier!

## Description

Atlas: Comic Courier is a space flight/combat game set in a polluted future where humanity has expanded to other planets. As a pilot of the AT-1AS transporter, your mission is to navigate through debris fields and hostile spacecraft to transport vital resources and aid the development of budding colonies. Beware of space pirates who seek to intercept your cargo and hinder progress.

- Warp Drive: Activate the onboard warp drive 30 seconds before reaching lightspeed to traverse vast distances.
- Combat: Utilize onboard weapon systems to clear transport routes of space pirates.
- Proximity Sensors: Stay alert for incoming projectiles and respond quickly with the onboard boost drive to increase speed and avoid collisions.
- System Mapping: Access a comprehensive map interface that tracks your transport routes, provides shortest paths, and alerts you of pirate activity.
- Transport Playlist: Customize your experience by uploading your favorite songs to the onboard music system and enjoy them while making transports.
- Risk and Reward: Evaluate the probabilities of collision-free warp drive activation. Time it perfectly to maximize efficiency or take a calculated risk for greater rewards.
