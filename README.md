# Atlas: Comic Courier
Welcome to the repository for Atlas: Cosmic Courier!

## Description

Atlas: Comic Courier is a space flight/combat game set in a polluted future where humanity has expanded to other planets. As a pilot of the AT-1AS transporter, your mission is to navigate through debris fields and hostile spacecraft to transport vital resources and aid the development of budding colonies. Beware of space pirates who seek to intercept your cargo and hinder progress.

## Gameplay

- Pilot the AT-1AS transporter using smooth, dynamic flight mechanics.
- Activate the onboard warp drive 30 seconds before reaching lightspeed to finish the transport. Make sure you're path to the objective is sufficiently clear!
- Utilize onboard weapon systems to defend the cargo.
- Stay alert for incoming projectiles and respond quickly with the boost drive to avoid nasty collisions.
- Access a comprehensive map that tracks your transport routes, provides shortest paths, and alerts you of hostile activity across the system.
- Customize your experience by uploading your favorite songs to the onboard music system and enjoy them while making transports!
- Evaluate the probabilities of collision-free warp drive activation. Time it perfectly to maximize efficiency or take a calculated risk to complete the assignment quickly.

## Progression and Scoring

- Earn the starter rank and badge upon completing the tutorial. Improve your rank based on fastest transport times, difficulty, and completion rate.
- Unlock more challenging transports with greater rewards as you advance in rank.
- Pirate factions will become stronger or weaker depending on transport history (completion, in-level performance, etc.)
- Monitor the development percentage of each planet on the mapping page.
- Achieve 100% development on every planet to clear the debris fields and make them self-sufficient. Receive your certificate of achievement, lifetime transport route, and comprehensive end-game stats.
